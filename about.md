## about me
My name is Ajay. I am a coder who likes to experiment with new languages and technologies and build things that help people. All of my work is open source and can be found on GitHub. I've written some [node.js packages](http://npmjs.org/~ajaymt), a [Mac app](http://ajaymt.github.com/Kickstarter), a small [project scaffolding tool](http://github.com/code-boilerplates/bp), and I'm working on lots of interesting stuff right now including a [web framework](http://github.com/AjayMT/cheese). When I'm not busy coding or doing school-related things, I might write about something and post it here.

## about this site
This is a blog built with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and hosted on GitHub Pages. The theme and layouts are designed and built by me, and the site uses the Inconsolata font. All of the code was written within Emacs :)
