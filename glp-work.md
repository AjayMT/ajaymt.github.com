## Identify the different perspectives and discuss

The perspectives involved are:
- Dr. C's perspective
- the senior surgeon's perspective
- their fellow doctors
- the hospital
- the patients of the senior surgeon

### Dr. C's perspective
Dr. C is concerned for the patients of the senior surgeon and the ethicality of the surgeon's actions. He is hesitant to report the surgeon because he believes that the hospital and his fellow doctors would not accept or acknowledge his criticism of a more senior doctor.

### The senior surgeon's perspective
The surgeon believes that his seniority and experience exempts him from having to adhere strictly to the Medical Ethics Manual. He thinks his job is secure -- he will not be fired by the hospital and any accusations made against him will be disregarded. He is either not primarily concerned with the safety of his patients, or believes that his methods and practices work better than modern techniques.

### Their fellow doctors
The other doctors in the hospital respect the senior surgeon and probably would not accuse him of malpractice, or entertain any accusations made against him. They recognize that he is not likely to be fired by the hospital or penalized in any way.

### The hospital
The hospital seeks to provide the best treatment available to its patients. It may not be aware of the surgeon's use of outdated techniques, since he has not been reported. The higher authorities in the hospital respect the surgeon, and would not fire him readily, unless any accusations made against him can be backed up by evidence.

### The patients
The patients may not be aware of the fact that they are receving unsafe treatment and are subject to outdated procedures. They trust the surgeon because of his seniority and experience.
