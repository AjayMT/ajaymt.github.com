Like most programmers, I don't write perfect code. In fact, my code is usually pretty crappy: tons of bugs, lots of room for optimisation, lots of inconsistency, and just bad code in general. I don't like it, but I've come to accept it. I am a bad programmer.

And yet, in spite of this, I push my code to GitHub and publish npm packages, so that everyone can see how bad my code is. Why do I do that? Because I've realised this:

**The only way to get better at coding is coding.**

When you think about it, this makes complete sense: building things and writing code is the only way you can practise coding.

Making your code open and visibe to everyone forces you to make it clean and readable. The only way to get better is to keep writing and pushing your crappy code. I know it's bad, but it'll get better.
