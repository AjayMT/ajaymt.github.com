I like writing profanely. It feels quite liberating to use words like 'fuck' in an otherwise boringly formal-sounding piece of writing. That's probably because I don't use those words very often.

Not that I don't curse verbally--I do that quite often (which is probably why it's lost its effect on me). I just happen to write very blandly, contrasting my colourful verbal self. So every once in a while, I feel the need to include the odd fuck or shit.

And it feels good too--like I've unlocked a universe of artistic freedom, where it's okay to sound like an eloquent idiot. Once I've started, I can't stop. My writing will go back to being the uninteresting shit that it was if I stop.

Plus, these words sound good. They're satisfying to say and to write. It feels like I'm punching a hole through society's superficial wall of decency when I use a word like cunt or fuck. It always feels good to be a rebel.
